- âš¡ **Auto Rotation**: Smooth automatic rotation with toggle control
- ðŸŽ¨ **Modern UI**: Beautiful gradient background with glassmorphism effects
- ðŸ“± **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- ðŸŽª **Smooth Animations**: Fluid transitions and hover effects
- ðŸ”„ **Realistic Scramble**: Proper Rubik's cube notation and mechanics
- ðŸ§© **Cube Mechanics**: Center pieces are fixed, proper face rotations
- ðŸ“Š **Scramble Display**: Shows current scramble sequence and status

## Technologies Used

- **React 18** - Modern React with hooks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd rubiks-cube
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RubiksCube.js    # Main 3D cube component with state management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Controls.js      # UI controls component
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ InfoPanel.js     # Information display component
â”œâ”€â”€ App.js               # Main application component
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js            # React entry point
â””â”€â”€ index.css           # Global styles
```

## Controls

- **Mouse/Touch**: Drag to rotate the cube manually
- **Scroll**: Zoom in/out
- **Auto Rotate**: Toggle automatic rotation
- **Manual Rotate**: Toggle manual rotation mode
- **Reset**: Reset cube to solved state
- **Scramble**: Randomly scramble the cube using proper notation
- **Solve**: Automatically solve the cube

## Cube Mechanics

### Physical Constraints
- **Center Pieces**: Fixed in place and never move (as in a real Rubik's cube)
- **Edge Pieces**: Have 2 colors and move between edge positions
- **Corner Pieces**: Have 3 colors and move between corner positions
- **Face Rotations**: Each face (F, B, R, L, U, D) rotates independently

### Scramble Algorithm
- Uses standard Rubik's cube notation (F, B, R, L, U, D)
- Avoids redundant moves (same face twice in a row)
- Generates 20 random moves for a proper scramble
- Smooth animations between each move
- Visual feedback showing scramble progress

### Face Notation
- **F**: Front face (white)
- **B**: Back face (yellow)
- **R**: Right face (red)
- **L**: Left face (orange)
- **U**: Up face (blue)
- **D**: Down face (green)

## Features in Detail

### 3D Cube Structure
- 27 individual cube pieces (3x3x3)
- Each piece has 6 faces with proper colors
- Realistic materials and lighting
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Proper state management for cube positions

### Interactive Controls
- Orbit controls for camera manipulation
- Toggle buttons for different rotation modes
- Action buttons for cube manipulation
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Real-time scramble status display

### Visual Design
- Gradient background with modern aesthetics
- Glassmorphism UI elements
- Smooth hover animations
- Professional color scheme
- Information panel with cube mechanics
